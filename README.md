Add notes to entire team here (as well as commit texts).
At the end of each session, there will be a review on the work that has been completed and what needs doing -- Teams open to initial investigation to determine what the data is telling us and how we are going to process that data to come to the conslusion of what Algorithms we will be using and to provide incite in how we proceed in team analysis.
