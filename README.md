  - Split the data present into a 6 way for the 6 team members -- 19 years each.


FOR NEXT WEEK:
Look at data -- look for patterns, put a script around it; this is what we found.
This data, how it relates to "x". 
Review afterwards, should be simular -- go with whichever one is clearer, template forward.
At that point, full woprking model of data - see how we programme it.
Analysed the data already, is, telling us, fundementals.
Code and variables, ect.
